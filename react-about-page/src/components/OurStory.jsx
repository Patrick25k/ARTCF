                        <p>
                            Founded in 1988 and received legal status as a non-governmental organisation in Rwanda in April 1991 and renewable in September 2005. ARTCF aimed to improve life conditions of people by fighting poverty especially alongside poor women. We organise professional training and giving material and financial assistance for the impoverished Rwandan women to get out from socio-economical and cultural isolation.
                        </p>
                        <p>ARTCF was set up by an initiative of a group of Rwandan women, who found difficulties in which the women were struggling by raising children alone, having no stable wage jobs, and having no supports either material or moral, in order to achieve objectives to assist these impoverished women materially, morally and culturally.</p>
                        
                        <p>The context analysis of ARTCF reveals that people living in poverty largely are the women who live in rural areas and in some parts surrounding Kigali city. These are poor people but economically active deserving particular kick-start of the ARTCF's interventions in eradicating poverty. ARTCF will work with them and their organizations to empower them to engage with duty bearers to respond to their needs. ARTCF works also in partnership with other institutions engaged in combating poverty. Empowerment of women, to have a strong says in family and community decisions and control is among main focus, while men's awareness is also considered.</p>
                        <p>ARTCF facilitates the active participation and ownership of community members in all aspects of their development. The aim being to support a culture of reciprocal relationships, mutual accountability, shared decision making and values. That participation seeks to develop capacity of the communities and facilitate a deepened critical thinking and awareness in all the communities. ARTCF encourages a culture of dialogue and sharing of information among the various programs and projects.</p>
                        <p>Integration:
                            ARTCF makes effort to reinforce systems and structures that ensure that into all fields of its interventions following key factors are combined to speed up significant changes in beneficiaries living conditions: Income, education, Health, Nutrition Lifestyle. This package is delivered entirely in ideal way; nevertheless, a minimum can't go down a trio. All interventions are integrated, coordinated and harmonized to minimize waste and duplication. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Today, ARTCF works with partners worldwide to implement programs that address the unique needs of each community we serve. Our approach is collaborative, inclusive, and focused on long-term impact.</p>
